# Web-Based-Calculator
This is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports arithmetic operations. It also provides functionalities to clear the screen, delete the last entry, and reset the entire input and allows chaining of multiple operations. I used a grid layout for an organized and user-friendly interface.
